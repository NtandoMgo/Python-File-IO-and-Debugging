# Python File IO and Debugging
This repository contains Python programs for file input/output operations and debugging assistance. These programs were developed as part of the CSC1015F Assignment 10. Below are the details of each program:

## Anagram Search (anagramsearch.py)
This Python program searches a file for anagrams of a given word, printing the results in alphabetical order. An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word. 
**Example usage:**
***** Anagram Finder *****
Enter a word:
triangle
['alerting', 'altering', 'integral']

## Anagram Sets (anagramsets.py)
This program asks the user to enter a word length and a filename. It searches a specified file for sets of words that are of the given length and are anagrams of each other, then writes the results to a new file. 
**Example usage:**
***** Anagram Set Search *****
Enter word length:
12
Searching...
Enter file name:
twelve.txt
Writing results...
